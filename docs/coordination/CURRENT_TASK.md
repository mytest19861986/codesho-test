# Current Task: SPRINT1-OPENAPI-CONTRACT-DRIFT-REMEDIATION-73B

- Owner: Codex, directed by Commander AI.
- Status: `IMPLEMENTED / LOCAL_GATES_PASS / CLAUDE_PASS / CI_PENDING`.
- Base branch: `codesho-test/main`.
- Base SHA: `dca0800fd74fb3e852aacb9122e6c533538d2629`.
- Branch: `codex/task73b-openapi-contract-drift`.

## Goal

Eliminate OpenAPI contract drift through an isolated `drf-spectacular`
projection while preserving runtime URLs, auth, sessions, CSRF, cookies,
tenant middleware and business logic.

## Exact allow-list

1. `backend/config/openapi_schema.py`
2. `backend/config/openapi_urls.py`
3. `backend/config/settings/base.py`
4. `backend/tests/test_openapi_contract.py`
5. `docs/openapi.yaml`
6. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
7. `docs/coordination/CURRENT_TASK.md`
8. `docs/coordination/PROJECT_STATE.md`
9. `docs/coordination/CODEX_TO_COMMANDER.md`

No other file may change.

## Acceptance

- Generated schema is deterministic and exposes exactly six approved operations.
- Generated schema is byte-equal to `docs/openapi.yaml`; schema and Swagger
  are fail-closed for anonymous and non-staff users.
- Runtime/projection path names, callback identities and HTTP methods are
  parity-tested; unapproved endpoints are absent.
- Runtime CSRF, session, cookie, status and Retry-After behavior is unchanged.
- Ruff, MyPy, Django check, migration check, focused/full backend tests,
  schema validation and `git diff --check` pass.
- Claude implementation Review 02 passed with zero open blockers.
